### Required input files

1. data/tsne{01..30}.txt

Inter-gene Euclidean distances (in t-SNE 2D plot space) between all pairs of genes.
These are large files... 3GB each.

Column 0 = ignored
Column 1 = GeneID1
Column 2 = GeneID2
Column 3 = distance

One file for each t-SNE replicate


2. filtered-data/tsne{01..30}.txt

Same as above but filtered to exclude pairs of genes with distance > 5



### How to generate the distance files for the web interface

1. run ./distance-stats-merge.pl (see comments at start of script for info)

2. run ./add-local-distance-stats.pl (ditto)
